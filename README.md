# Tugboat starter template for the Laravel PHP Framework

This is a [configuration file](https://github.com/TugboatQA/Laravel/blob/master/.tugboat/config.yml) for spinning 
up a new [Laravel instance](https://laravel.com) in Tugboat. 

[Tugboat](https://tugboat.qa) is free to use. It comes in handy to automatically build out a fully working version of the site for every pull request, branch or tag. 

## Installation

1. Fork this repository and create a new project in [Tugboat](https://dashboard2.tugboat.qa/). Then, connect your forked repos to Tugboat. 
    
That's it. For more information check out the [Tugboat documentation](https://docs.tugboat.qa) to see what else you can do. If you have any questions, [hit us up in Slack](https://launchpass.com/tugboatqa). May the wind always be at your back. --Matt
